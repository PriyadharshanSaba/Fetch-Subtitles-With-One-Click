<h2><b> PD_SubsRETR : A Mac service</b></h2>

A Mac OSX / macOS service which <b>Fetches you Movie Subtitles with a click</b>.
Right click on a movie file and you can find the service 'Fetch Subtitles' at the bottom of the list.
Click it, and that's all you've got to do...
Or maybe rest back and breath in, and out. There you go, your subtitles will be present in '<b>PD_SubsRETR</b>' under Movies directory.

Pull the repo and install the Mac Workflow 'Fetch Subtitles'. 


<b>Note: </b> You must add your python2 packages path at line 30 -> sys.path.append("<your path>").
